About This Guide
================

This resource collects the advice and experience of journalists,
newsroom developers, and security experts, organized into a set of
lessons and training materials available for {{ target_audience_lower }} staff who find
themselves leading security trainings. In a moment when reporters are
asking how to protect themselves and their sources, we want to see 
more people armed to answer those questions and help {{ target_audience_lower }}s
communicate and store data more securely.

The curriculum is hosted by `OpenNews <https://opennews.org/>`__, a team
that helps developers, designers, and data analysts convene and
collaborate on open journalism projects, and `BuzzFeed Open
Lab <https://www.buzzfeed.com/openlab>`__, an arts and technology
fellowship program at BuzzFeed News. The first draft began during a
two-day event in June 2017, with about 20 people working in-person and
remote.

.. note::

   While the original version of this document was written for journalists and
   newsrooms, the concepts, tools, and related materials are also applicable in
   other domains. This fork of the original document has been customized for a
   different target audience, that of {{ target_audience_lower }}s.  This is primarily
   done through substituting the word "newsroom" with "{{ target_audience_lower
   }}" throughout the document that was originally produced by OpenNews and
   BuzzFeed Open Lab.
